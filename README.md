# Project_Shell
Shell made during the OS2 course


## **Atual Status**

  *04/21/16*: We have a parser working fine. Although I suggest rewrite it later, due to performance problems generated by realloc statement.

## **Next Goals**
  *NO DATE*: get the fork/exec loops working perfectly.

After it *wait for next instructions - we'll have to deal with assinchronous signals later.*



## **Maintenance**
  **No Date**: Write a decent Makefile. This includes:
  1. create dynamic libs.
  2. Use a general structure **anyhow**
  
  **No Date**: rewrite our Parser:
  1. Eliminate realloc.
