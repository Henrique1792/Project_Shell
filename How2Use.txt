Hello!


Welcome to shue! (We didn't have a better name at the time).

This file will help you to use this project.


1. Clone it 
 Run  git clone https://github.com/Henrique1792/Project_Shell command.

2: Build it
 Run make command.

3: Execute it
 Run make run command;
or
  run ./shue command.

3.1 - Usability
  While you're using shue, type default linux commands. It'll work fine. Trust me =)

3.2 - Quitting
  while running shue, type "quit", and the shell finalizes =) .
3.2 - Appendix
  Some functions still have problems (like pipe and redirect output), so I warn you to stay away from them, at least now.

3.3 - Clean dependencies
  Run make clean (BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU WRITE THIS COMMAND, TRULLY).


Thank you for reading!
